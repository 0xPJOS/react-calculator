# Future Steps

1. Math, rounding up or down or whatever.
2. Buttons, colour stays after released on mobile.
3. Accessibility

- Button names
- Contrast ratio
- Semantic HTML

1. Remove curse words
2. Better names for functions and variables in general
3. Refactor code... When I know more... Lots of if checks and stuff.  
   Can it be done better? Almost definitely. Code is not dry.
4. Title and Meta-tags
5. Screen drag

- Check when text comes close to left edge, reduce size to a minimum size
- Then let it over flow. But have the ability to click/tap drag the screen to the right to view the entire equation.

9. When click AC the screen should display 0? Or just not have 0 there to begin with...
10. Is there a way to keep the buttons perfectly circular in a grid that is also responsive?
11. Modal explaining the project, my first hard one. Much proud. But don't hate the code. Or do, just let me know how to make it better.
