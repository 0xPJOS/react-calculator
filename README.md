# react-calculator

It's a calculator. But built with React. I'll never have to buy another calculator again. I'm taking an online React course and gave this is a go to practice using React.
* Used Vite to scaffold a React project
* Vite SVGR to load in SVG graphics for the buttons
* The h1 font is Satoshi and the mono-spaced font is Tabular, both from [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/). They have quite a few decent fonts, all open-source and designed by bona-fide typographers.
